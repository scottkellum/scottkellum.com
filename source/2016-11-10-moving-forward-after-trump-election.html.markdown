The presidential nominee and his vice president ran on a campaign filled with hate and fear. Millions of Americans are left feeling unwelcome in this nation and unrepresented in their government. While Trump won the election, he still has a responsibility to serve everyone he insulted and demeaned during his campaign. I will be budgeting monthly donations to the following charities to help protect those most vulnerable in the coming years and, if you can afford it, recommend you budget monthly donations as well.

## [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/)

The ACLU uses the court system as a check against government aggression and overreach. They will stand up against unconstitutional acts by this administration and congress and are [prepared to take on Trump](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/if-donald-trump-implements-his-proposed-policies-well-see-him-court).

## [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People](http://www.naacp.org/)

Trump’s language indicates a profound ignorance towards people of color, often [downright racist](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/paul-ryan-trump-judge-223991). The NAACP has been a strong voice for people of color for decades and will be crucial in informing legislation and protecting people from legislation throughout the duration of this administration.

## [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/)

Mike Pence has one of the [worst track records on women’s reproductive rights](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a4494411/mike-pence-anti-abortion-views/) and Trump stated that women should be [punished for having an abortion](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/us/politics/donald-trump-abortion.html). Planned Parenthood provides numerous reproductive health services to communities that need them as well as lobbying for policies that promote reproductive health. Under a trump administration and this congress their funding is at risk and they will need to work hard to preserve women’s reproductive rights.

## [Friends Committee on National Legislation](https://www.fcnl.org/)

FCNL is a Quaker organization that lobbies for peace and justice legislation around a variety of issues from climate change to criminal justice reform to foreign policy. They have a long track record of being effective in creating positive change.

## [National Center for Transgender Equality](http://www.transequality.org/)

Trans rights have gained some momentum in recent years but the work is still just beginning. Because the government keeps track of gender in legal documents, having an administration that understands trans issues in important to move things forward. The National Center for Transgender Equality works to help pass trans inclusive laws and policy as well as individuals needing help.

## [CAIR Coalition](https://www.caircoalition.org/)

Immigrants need our help more than ever with the rampant xenophobia as a pillar of the Trump campaign. CAIR works with immigrants to provide legal assistance and keeps families together.

# It takes more than donations

It takes more than donations to enact change. The hate of the campaign has normalized and promoted dangerous xenophobic, racist, homophobic, and misogynistic behavior. We need to stay vigilant and stand up for each other. When we see abuse we need to make it known that it’s not acceptable. All Americans have the right to freedom, life, and liberty and this election does not change that.
