I am a proud American, the son of an immigrant mother from South Africa and on my Fathers’ side, my Quaker ancestors immigrated to this country to escape religious persecution in England. Around the time of the Civil War the Kellums fled North Carolina in opposition to slavery and found affordable land in Indiana. Freedom is our most fundamental American value, a freedom that not only extends to all Americans but people across the globe. For centuries we have taken in immigrants and refugees escaping violence, economic turmoil, and religious persecution. America has been the last beacon of hope for those who have none. These freedoms are what brought my family to America and I don’t take them for granted.

Freedom is still an elusive goal. On a personal level, as a white man, my freedom has never been questioned but hard battles have been fought for freedoms for people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ persons. These battles are still being fought today and for many Americans, the goal isn’t to make American great again, but to finally make America great for everyone. We all share the same American dream. America’s founding fathers, civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Immigrants and refugees coming to America, and I all have the same dream of freedom. Tomorrow we decide between continuing the American dream or terminating the dream for so many Americans. As for me, I will proudly be voting for Hillary Clinton to carry out the American dream of freedom for all.
