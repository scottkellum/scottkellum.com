Our universe is made up of lots of stuff and we have no idea what it is. In fact, about 85 percent of our universe is filled with this unknown, or dark matter. We can’t see it directly but it has a huge effect on the matter we can see. The design process is similar to this. So much of what we do as designers can’t be guaged or measured. When we are away from our sketch books and computers we are off doing things in our lives spending time not thinking about work. But really, thats when ideas strike.
