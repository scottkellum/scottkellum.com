My wife and I are buying a house in LA. We are thrilled and terrified to be making such a big decision together. Our beloved one-bedroom is big, but not big enough for our family of 4. The rent also increased $325/month which is too much. We embarked on a journey to find something. We looked at single-family homes, condos, and multi-family units and settled on a small 4-unit property a few blocks from where we’re living now. The journey has been full of ups and downs. While we have a lot more to go through to transition into the new place, the chapter of finding a place is over and I have a lot to say about it.

## High density living

Single-family homes are expensive near any major metropolitan area. In my opinion, that’s a good thing. Here in LA we are facing a major housing crisis. Many factors go into the problem, but simply put there just isn’t enough housing to go around. We quickly focused our attention to multi-family buildings, co-ops, and condos. Not only do we like living in higher-density housing, but things started to get dramatically more affordable and make financial sense.

Co-ops and condos are hard to find in LA, and the condos we did find were still overpriced. They started around $550k in the neighborhoods we were looking at not counting the HOA fees. When a 3 bed 3 bath we were looking at wouldn’t entertain the idea of converting one of those bathrooms into a laundry room we stopped looking at condos to focus on multi-family properties.

There are plenty of multi-family properties in LA and they go for about the same price as a single-family home. With no HOA fees, control over the property, and tenants helping with expenses, this option made the most sense for both our living and financial situation.

## Affording a house in 2024

Work with people, don’t do it all yourself. Mortgage brokers are worth it and will save you money. Unless you are buying off-market, everyone is getting a cut from the transaction and you might as well have that go to people you trust. Your agent and mortgage broker will work as a team to support you in this transaction.

### Down payment

If you have been working at a job with benefits for a while, you likely have a decent chunk of change in a 401k. As a first-time home buyer you can use that money and put it towards your new home. FHA and Fannie Mae backed conventional loans take as little as 5% as a down payment, meaning $80k can get you started in a million dollar property. FHA loans are wonderful, but require the home to be inspected and up to code before closing.
