Joshua Tree, California is a very sci-fi place. Year-round, the area’s population remains very low. The air is desiccated, the sunrises are violent. At almost 800,000 acres, it is abundant with surreal and empty space. This is the same kind of blank canvas Cate Le Bon tends to make music in, her songs like strange buildings in the middle of the desert. It is also where the Welsh-born artist has been residing for the last year and change, since finishing her forthcoming sixth solo album, Pompeii.

Art-glam and Dadaist in nature, both as a musician and a producer for others, Le Bon creates with the discipline of a designer, rigorously constructing and reconstructing sound until it commands all sense of space and time. Listening to her lopsided rock and cool-toned avant-pop over the last decade, the parallels between music and architectural design—their shared desire to turn the abstract into something solid with texture, rhythm, harmony, and pattern—becomes apparent. Where the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once described architecture as “frozen music,” Le Bon’s music could similarly be described today as liquid architecture.

Le Bon lives with the musician and visual artist Tim Presley, with whom she also collaborates under the name DRINKS. Their home in JT resembles a desert ski lodge with its wooden interiors, abstract paintings, and fireplace straight out of The Muppet Christmas Carol. A large, empty vase looms in the living room, dried flowers hang in the kitchen. When I visit in late November, there’s a deep sense of calm in the house, a genuine ease. Le Bon and Presley are both attentive in a way that’s almost waiterly, the kind of people who ask whether you’d like a refill when you’re two-thirds into a drink. Wearing a black sports jacket with Burberry sunglasses atop her head, Le Bon gracefully exhibits a sense of total self-possession and wholeness. In most other circumstances, being around that energy might feel intimidating, prone to making one feel fractured and neurotic in comparison. But in Le Bon’s case, her sheer magnetism leaves only a contact high.
